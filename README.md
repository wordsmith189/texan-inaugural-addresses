# "Texan Inaugural Speeches: A Computational Analysis"


My area of academic interest is Texas English (TxE), and in this study I look at the language as used in inaugural speeches by US Presidents from Texas. When I say "from" Texas, that is with some license: maybe it's better to say "Texan" presidents? Anyway, the group is:

- Lyndon B. Johnson,
- George H.W. Bush, and
- George W. Bush.

The interest is in the words as written on the page, not in aspects of voice or accent.

The material in this repo is published as a website at this address: **[texan-inaugurals.netlify.app](https://texan-inaugurals.netlify.app)**.
