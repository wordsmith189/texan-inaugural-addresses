My name is Lars Hinrichs and I'm an Associate Professor in English Language and Linguistics at UT Austin. You can find more about me [here](http://larshinrichs.site), and about the Texas English Linguistics Lab [here](www.texasenglish.org).

Presented on this blog are some analyses of the language that was used in the "Texan" inaugural addresses that the country has had so far. I made these to prepare for our segment about Texan inaugurals on [The Texas Standard](https://www.texasstandard.org/stories/categories/texan-translation/). The Texan Translation segment is produced by Michael Marks.

The Texas Standard, hosted by David Brown, is a news magazine that airs weekdays on [KUT Public Radio](www.kut.org) in Austin.

Analyses were conducted in R [@rcoreteam2020] and `tidyverse` [@wickham2019] using the RStudio GUI [@rstudioteam2020].

The text of the inaugural addresses was obtained from the `quanteda` R-package [@benoit2018].

This website was made using the `distill` package for R [@allaire2020].
