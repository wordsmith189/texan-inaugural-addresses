## Welcome

My name is Lars Hinrichs. You can find more information about me [here](https://larshinrichs.site), and about the Texas English Linguistics Lab [here](www.texasenglish.org).

Presented on this blog are some analyses of the language that was used in the "Texan" inaugural addresses that the country has had so far. I made these to prepare for our segment about Texan inaugurals on [The Texas Standard](https://www.texasstandard.org/stories/categories/texan-translation/).

<aside>The Texas Standard, hosted by David Brown, is a news magazine that airs weekdays on [KUT Public Radio](www.kut.org) in Austin.

The producer of the Texan Translation segment is Michael Marks.
