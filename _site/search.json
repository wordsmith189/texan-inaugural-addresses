You can find more information about me here, and about the Texas English Linguistics Lab here.\nPresented on this blog are some analyses of the language that was used in the “Texan” inaugural addresses that the country has had so far. I made these to prepare for our segment about Texan inaugurals on The Texas Standard.\n\nThe Texas Standard, hosted by David Brown, is a news magazine that airs weekdays on KUT Public Radio in Austin.\nThe producer of the Texan Translation segment is Michael Marks.\n\n\n\n",
