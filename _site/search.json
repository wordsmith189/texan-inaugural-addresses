You can find more information about me here, and about the Texas English Linguistics Lab here.\nPresented on this blog are some analyses of the language that was used in the “Texan” inaugural addresses that the country has had so far. I made these to prepare for our segment about Texan inaugurals on The Texas Standard.\nThe Texas Standard, hosted by David Brown, is a news magazine that airs weekdays on KUT Public Radio in Austin.\nThe Texan Translation segment is produced by Michael Marks.\nAnalyses were conducted in R (R Core Team 2020) and tidyverse (Wickham et al. 2019) using the RStudio GUI (RStudio Team 2020).\nThe text of the inaugural addresses was obtained from the quanteda R-package (Benoit et al. 2018).\nThis website was made using the distill package for R (Allaire et al. 2020).\nCode for this website is hosted at this Github repo.\n\n\n\nAllaire, J.
