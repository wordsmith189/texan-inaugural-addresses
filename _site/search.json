You can find more about me here, and about the Texas English Linguistics Lab here.\nPresented on this blog are some analyses of the language that was used in the “Texan” inaugural addresses that the country has had so far. I made these to prepare for our segment about Texan inaugurals on The Texas Standard. The Texan Translation segment is produced by Michael Marks.\nThe Texas Standard, hosted by David Brown, is a news magazine that airs weekdays on KUT Public Radio in Austin.\nAnalyses and visualizations were conducted in R (R Core Team 2020) and tidyverse (Wickham et al. 2019) using the RStudio GUI (RStudio Team 2020). The central package used in the NLP transformations is tidytext (Silge and Robinson 2016). The text of the inaugural addresses was obtained from the quanteda R-package (Benoit et al. 2018). POS-tagging was performed with cleanNLP (Arnold 2017) and reticulate (Ushey, Allaire, and Tang 2020).\nThis website was made using the distill package for R (Allaire et al. 2020).\n\n\n\nAllaire, J.
