If we were interested in place of birth, we’d also have to include Eisenhower (born in TX but didn’t live there), and not the Bushes (born outside of TX but lived there).\n\n\n\nSource of the data\nWe’re using the version of the speeches that is included in the quanteda R-package (Benoit et al. 2018).

It is calculated using a formula that takes into account both each word’s raw frequency as well as the number of documents in the corpus in which it is used. This method is a way of finding out the most distinctive words in each text.\ntf-idf is defined in detail here.\nFor example, in the context at hand, you might expect that each of the four speeches contains the words freedom or people. And while it is certainly interesting which president used them the most, these words aren’t really distinctive, simply because each president uses them on this occasion. But it’s instructive to look at the words that are both frequent and unique to each speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Top 15 terms in each Texan inaugural address by tf-idf.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\n\nContents\nTwo meaningful words\nA look at all connectors in comparison\n\n\n\n\nTwo meaningful words\nThere is a theory that the combined frequencies of and and but correlate to the success of a political speech as a communicative action. Why is this? Both and and but are coordinating conjunctions, i.e. they are used to combined clauses into longer sentences. Unless you are going to have a very simple sentence with just one subject and one predicate, you will need to use a conjunction. Arguably, and and but are the simplest of all conjunctions.\n\n\n\n\n\ndoc_id\n\n\nword\n\n\nn\n\n\ntotal\n\n\nfreq\n\n\n1965-Johnson\n\n\nand\n\n\n65\n\n\n1490\n\n\n43.624161\n\n\n1965-Johnson\n\n\nbut\n\n\n13\n\n\n1490\n\n\n8.724832\n\n\n1989-Bush\n\n\nand\n\n\n98\n\n\n2318\n\n\n42.277826\n\n\n1989-Bush\n\n\nbut\n\n\n26\n\n\n2318\n\n\n11.216566\n\n\n2001-Bush\n\n\nand\n\n\n82\n\n\n1585\n\n\n51.735016\n\n\n2001-Bush\n\n\nbut\n\n\n12\n\n\n1585\n\n\n7.570978\n\n\n2005-Bush\n\n\nand\n\n\n108\n\n\n2073\n\n\n52.098408\n\n\n2005-Bush\n\n\nbut\n\n\n5\n\n\n2073\n\n\n2.411963\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that and and but are most frequent in the latter Bush’s speeches. So tentatively, he is the one who most embraces simple (clear?) rhetoric.\nA look at all connectors in comparison\nBut the occurrence of and and but depends on other aspects of the language used, e.g. how many sentences are used, how many connectors are in text overall, etc. And and but are in a group of other coordinators.\nEnglish coordinating conjunctions\nFor\nAnd\nNor\nBut\nOr\nYet\nSo\n(Mnemonic: FANBOYS.)\nAnd then there are the subordinating conjunctions, which are used to construct sentences that are syntactically complex.\nEnglish subordinating conjunctions\nO = only if, once\nN = now that\nA = although, after, as\nW = while, when, whereas, whenever, wherever, whether\nH = how\nI = if, in case, in order that\nT = though\nE = even though, even if\nB = because, before\nU = until, unless\nS = since, so, so that\n(Mnemonic: ON A WHITE BUS.)\nSo to gain perspective let’s visualize three figures per speech:\nthe aggregate frequency of and/but,\nall other coordinators combined, and\nall subordinators combined.\n\n\n\nHere, then, is the real finding. The and/but comparison is really not what distinguishes these three presidents, or the four speeches. By far the most notable change is that Bush 43, in his second inaugural address, decreases his use of subordinators compared to previous Texan inaugurals, but not of and or but.\nAnd this is despite the fact that the second inaugural of Bush 43 had longer sentences on average than any of the others, as we saw in this post.\nSo we might say: after 9-11, Bush’s messaging has tightened up and simplified notably. He has lost 25% of his subordinating conjunctions – that’s a very significant drop in the world of corpus linguistics.\nYou could call this shift dramatic without being wrong.\n\n\n\n",
