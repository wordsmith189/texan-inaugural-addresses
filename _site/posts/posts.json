    "contents": "\n\nContents\nTwo meaningful words\nA look at all connectors in comparison\n\nComplexity. (Image from J. Barkiple/unsplash.com.)Two meaningful words\nThere is a theory that the combined frequencies of and and but correlate to the success of a political speech as a communicative action. Why is this? Both and and but are coordinating conjunctions, i.e. they are used to combined clauses into longer sentences. Unless you are going to have a very simple sentence with just one subject and one predicate, you will need to use a conjunction. Arguably, and and but are the simplest of all conjunctions.\n\n\n\n\n\ndoc_id\n\n\nword\n\n\nn\n\n\ntotal\n\n\nfreq\n\n\n1965-Johnson\n\n\nand\n\n\n65\n\n\n1490\n\n\n43.624161\n\n\n1965-Johnson\n\n\nbut\n\n\n13\n\n\n1490\n\n\n8.724832\n\n\n1989-Bush\n\n\nand\n\n\n98\n\n\n2318\n\n\n42.277826\n\n\n1989-Bush\n\n\nbut\n\n\n26\n\n\n2318\n\n\n11.216566\n\n\n2001-Bush\n\n\nand\n\n\n82\n\n\n1585\n\n\n51.735016\n\n\n2001-Bush\n\n\nbut\n\n\n12\n\n\n1585\n\n\n7.570978\n\n\n2005-Bush\n\n\nand\n\n\n108\n\n\n2073\n\n\n52.098408\n\n\n2005-Bush\n\n\nbut\n\n\n5\n\n\n2073\n\n\n2.411963\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that and and but are most frequent in the latter Bush’s speeches. So tentatively, he is the one who most embraces simple (clear?) rhetoric.\nA look at all connectors in comparison\nBut the occurrence of and and but depends on other aspects of the language used, e.g. how many sentences are used, how many connectors are in text overall, etc. And and but are in a group of other coordinators.\nEnglish coordinating conjunctions\nFor\nAnd\nNor\nBut\nOr\nYet\nSo\n(Mnemonic: FANBOYS.)\nAnd then there are the subordinating conjunctions, which are used to construct sentences that are syntactically complex.\nEnglish subordinating conjunctions\nO = only if, once\nN = now that\nA = although, after, as\nW = while, when, whereas, whenever, wherever, whether\nH = how\nI = if, in case, in order that\nT = though\nE = even though, even if\nB = because, before\nU = until, unless\nS = since, so, so that\n(Mnemonic: ON A WHITE BUS.)\nSo to gain perspective let’s visualize three figures per speech:\nthe aggregate frequency of and/but,\nall other coordinators combined, and\nall subordinators combined.\n\n\n\nHere, then, is the real finding. The and/but comparison is really not what distinguishes these three presidents, or the four speeches. By far the most notable change is that Bush 43, in his second inaugural address, decreases his use of subordinators compared to previous Texan inaugurals, but not of and or but.\nAnd this is despite the fact that the second inaugural of Bush 43 had longer sentences on average than any of the others, as we saw in this post.\nSo we might say: after 9-11, Bush’s messaging has tightened up and simplified notably. He has lost 25% of his subordinating conjunctions – that’s a very significant drop in the world of corpus linguistics.\nYou could call this shift dramatic without being wrong.\n\n\n\n",

There is a group of parts of speech that pattern together with nouns. They are:\nnoun (NOUN)\nproper noun (PROPN)\nadjective (ADJ)\ndeterminer (DET)\npreposition (ADP)\nThe other group of tags that co-occur and that characterize a more verbal style are\nverb (VERB)\nauxiliary (AUX)\nadverb (ADV)\nconjunction (CCONJ, SCONJ)\nLet us treat the two groups in aggregate and compare the speeches for their frequencies.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Aggregate counts for nominal and verbal POS-groups in the speeches.\n\n\n\nThe speech that truly stands out (again) is 2005-Bush. He makes a clear switch to more nominal style, compensated by a drop in verbal tags, relative to his Texan predecessors.\nInterpretation: What is a “more nominal” style?\nA more nominal style corresponds to more “conceptual” thinking, whereas a more verbal style corresponds to more “dynamic” thinking. This conceptual-dynamic index (based on POS frequencies) has been shown to correlate with academic success in college students, where the students who show more nominal/conceptual styles in their admissions essays end up having significantly greater academic success over 4 years in college (Pennebaker et al. 2014). Written, academic texts are the most nominal on a continuum from verbal to nominal style; informal spoken conversations are the most verbal (Biber 1991).\nSo that is what we are looking at: Bush 43’s second inaugural reveals a significantly more conceptual, bookish style of thinking and speaking than what we see in the other Texan speeches. The post-9/11 Bush is the most academic figure among Texan presidents.\nWhat might be helpful is a qualitative follow-up analysis that looks at such questions as:\nWhat are all those nouns that Bush 43 uses in his second inaugural?\nAlso, some background research on who the speechwriters were would be of interest. Was there a significant change from Bush-2001 to Bush-2005?\nPronouns\nIt will be of interest to see which pronouns prevail in the four speeches. We will look at the different levels of person (1st person singular, 2nd person singular, and so on). Here is our definition of classes:\n\n\ns1 <- c(\"i\", \"my\", \"me\", \"myself\")\n\nsp2 <- c(\"you\", \"your\", \"yourself\")\n\ns3 <- c(\"he\", \"she\", \"it\", \"his\", \"her\", \"its\", \"him\",\n        \"himself\", \"herself\", \"itself\", \"something\",\n        \"everyone\", \"anything\")\n\np1 <- c(\"we\", \"our\", \"us\", \"ourselves\")\n\np3 <- c(\"they\", \"their\", \"them\", \"themselves\")\n\n\n\nSome notes:\nThe form yourselves does not occur in any of the speeches.\nOtherwise, the you-forms do not differ between singular and plural; therefore there is only one class for the second person.\nThe third-person pronoun they is only used in plural meaning in the speeches.\n\n\n\nA few clear trends are obvious:\n1st-person singular pronouns become increasingly infrequent; the fewest are in Bush 43’s second inaugural.\n3-p-sg. pronouns also are on the descent, with Bush 43 (2005) leading.\nThe same is true for 3-p-pl. pronouns.\nOn the increase is the direct address of listeners with you, your, etc.\nInterpretation: What pronoun frequencies mean\nAs Pennebaker has shown many times (Kacewicz et al. 2013; Pennebaker 2011), higher frequencies of 1-p-sg. pronouns correspond to weak sense of self, depression, lower positions in social hierarchies. By contrast, speakers and writers with a strong sense of self use low frequencies of 1-p-sg.; they instead address other and speak about others.\nBy these metrics, the second inaugural by George W. Bush is a reflection of a strong sense of self in the speaker. The stylistic elements in this speech project strength.\nWhat might be helpful is a qualitative follow-up analysis that looks at such questions as\nWhy are the 2-p pronouns so high in Bush 43’s second inaugural? Who is the you that he addresses?\nIf Bush 43’s second projects strength, does it also project unity? It is after all striking that the 1-p-pl. pronouns are so (relatively) infrequent.\nConclusion\nThe POS frequencies provide multiple hints that Bush-2005 stands out among Texan inaugurals. His position at the beginning of his second term was, of course, unique: he and the country were recovering from a big, national trauma. While Johnson’s time before his first inaugural was certainly not trauma-free (and, arguably, neither was Bush-41’s), the traumas that Bush 43 dealt with and the leadership demanded of him at this point were different in nature.\n\n\n\nArnold, Taylor. 2017. “A Tidy Data Model for Natural Language Processing Using cleanNLP.” The R Journal 9 (2): 120. https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2017/RJ-2017-035/index.html.\n\n\nBiber, Douglas. 1991.

When we look closer, we see that much of this is attributable to the hyper-frequent use of freedom and free.\nAll four speeches are reticent when it comes to negative terms.
